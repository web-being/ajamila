## Scroll animations

	1. scroll-timeline
		+ many use-cases
		- doesn't allow proper horizontal scroll (with other content available)
		- doesn't allow smooth transitions
		- can be limited with Safari

	2. prevent JS scroll manually
		+ more natural feel / logic: scrollbar is where you are on the page
		- difficulty with playing video
		- non-conducive: dragging scroll doesn't change anomation

	3. lenis.js
		- sluggish
			~ it's controllable, duration=0.1 works fine
		- non-standard API
		+ most reliable among others
		+ very simple
		+ minimal
		+ recommended by grok

	3.1 locomotive.js
		- sluggish, a bit less than lenis
		- forces css transforms for everything

	3.2 animate-on-scroll
		- less capabilities
		+ more reliable for iOS

	3.3 lax
